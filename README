new-search-results-notifier
===========================

Example App to let users perform advanced searches, save and subscribe to them to receive new results via email (in development, see DevLog.txt).

# Email notification of new results on preferred searches.
# Search and seed code from https://github.com/railscasts/111-advanced-search-form-revised 

The basic idea behind new search results is that Search has also a notified_at attribute with the timestamp of its last notification, so the find_new_results private method can filter products based on whether they were created or updated after the last notification. See Search#new_results.
