- First of all I need a user to log-in, perform advanced searches and save them.
-- going with devise
-- devise installed and set up

- I need a way to let users save their advanced searches and to subscribe to new results
-- Search belongs_to :user
-- User has_many :searches

-- Search new attributes: rails g migration add_user_options_to_searches user_id:integer saved:boolean, notified:boolean, notified_at:timestamp  

-- Gmail is good for up to 200 emails/day a lot of other professional services have a pricing shaped on day limit so it would be a good thing to consider this fact in designing the solution.   
-- alternatives to Gmail are http://www.mailjet.com/, http://sendgrid.com/, and http://mailchimp.com/ .

- Mailer setup
-- added proper code to setup gmail account in development.rb

rails generate mailer SearchNotifier new_search_results_for   

Notification is working, TODO: 

- run it from a cron job every day  
-- must chose among delayed_jobs, resque, sidekiq & co.
-- I'll go with delayed_jobs since is the simplest and doesn't require external dependencies. If needed I'll scale to a more performing solution.


- limit daily sends to a given number (default to 200)
- give user the possibility to define notification delay (deliver if last_send + delay < Time.now) 
- performance optimization
